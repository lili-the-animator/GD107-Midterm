	  <p id="story">After finding out the truth about his lineage, Zagreus decides to escape the underworld no matter what, going against his father's will. He is aided and encouraged in his journey by his mentor Achilles and his caretaker Nyx, who puts him into contact with the Olympian Gods who grant him boons to make him more powerful during his escape attempts.<br>
    In his escape attempts, Zagreus will start at Tartarus, continue upwards and end his journey at the surface, where he cannot stay for long and must return back down along the river. Along the way, he may meet many friendly faces who will help him. Zagreus is met with many obstacles in his journey upwards such as aggressive shades working for his father and has run-ins with the guardians of each region.</p>
